      <h3>
      The book was recommended to me by a close friend, but I had also heard about the book before as it is globally acclaimed. I’ve been wanting to get back into reading consistently again so I picked it up! 
      <br></br><br></br>
      The translation by Ken Liu was definitely pretty good especially towards the end of the book, but at times I didn’t feel completely immersed because of some choppy language. I talked to a friend who also read the book and she actually brought up a new perspective in terms of the translation! As we both can speak Mandarin, she mentioned that she liked Ken Liu’s translation because it was more true to the structure of Chinese grammar rather than changing the sentences to sound more fluid in English. I guess taking this into account I can appreciate the translation more, but as a primary and native English-speaker the wording did come off as awkward at times.

      It was hard to understand at first with the context of the Cultural Revolution, but I eventually got it and began to connect the dots within the story. The sci-fi aspect of the book really piqued my interest as I could recognize some terms and concepts, but others were new. The three-body problem as a real problem is interesting and learning about it through the game played in the book was incredibly helpful for visualization as well as entertaining. Also, the book also brought up some interesting current issues within our society, mentioning the controversial Cultural Revolution as well as the rise in people with no hope for humanity. While the hopefulness was in the context of people facing the apocalypse, it is still pertinent to our current world where we face issues like climate change that will have dire consequences on our future. Personally, seeing the views of the scholars in the Frontiers of Science organization gave me something to think about with all the different perspectives. 
      <br></br><br></br>
      Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who is into sci-fi books and especially if you’re looking to read a series. I’m looking forward to reading the next two books and seeing how the plot plays out!
