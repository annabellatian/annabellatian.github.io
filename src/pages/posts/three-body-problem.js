        The book was recommended to me by a close friend, but I had also heard about the book before as it is globally acclaimed. I’ve been wanting to get back into reading consistently again so I picked it up!

        The translation by Ken Liu was definitely pretty good especially towards the end of the book, but at times I didn’t feel completely immersed because of some choppy language. I talked to a friend who also read the book and she actually brought up a new perspective in terms of the translation! As we both can speak Mandarin, she mentioned that she liked Ken Liu’s translation because it was more true to the structure of Chinese grammar rather than changing the sentences to sound more fluid in English. I guess taking this into account I can appreciate the translation more, but as a primary and native English-speaker the wording did come off as awkward at times.

        It was hard to understand at first with the context of the Cultural Revolution, but I eventually got it and began to connect the dots within the story. The sci-fi aspect of the book really piqued my interest as I could recognize some terms and concepts, but others were new. The three-body problem as a real problem is interesting and learning about it through the game played in the book was incredibly helpful for visualization as well as entertaining. Also, the book also brought up some interesting current issues within our society, mentioning the controversial Cultural Revolution as well as the rise in people with no hope for humanity. While the hopefulness was in the context of people facing the apocalypse, it is still pertinent to our current world where we face issues like climate change that will have dire consequences on our future. Personally, seeing the views of the scholars in the Frontiers of Science organization gave me something to think about with all the different perspectives. 
        <br></br><br></br>
        Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who is into sci-fi books and especially if you’re looking to read a series. I’m looking forward to reading the next two books and seeing how the plot plays out!

        Firstly, connecting back to my comments on the first book of the trilogy, The Three-Body Problem, I liked the translation of this book more. It was more fluid than The Three-Body Problem, although this is probably because the wording wasn’t as close to the original Chinese version. This is interesting to me as it reflects the translation style of each translator, Cixin Liu and Joel Martinsen, which is an aspect in reading I’ve never really considered. 
        <br></br><br></br>
        In terms of the plot, I really enjoyed this book. Continuing from the first book, I was confused for a bit since there was some gap in time in the plot between the books but also it took me a while to start the second book after finishing the first book. Honestly, I’m so impressed with the creativity of Cixin Liu and found the book entertaining throughout — I ended up reading the last 200 pages of the book in one sitting! The fates of each of the Wallfacers makes me consider how I would act in these high-pressure, life-or-death situations, since it turns out these heroes on Earth seem to turn their back on most of humanity with the projects they come up with. And I guess the success of Luo Ji, who did not have any motivation to save humanity, is due to the fact that he was threatened with losing Zhuang Yan and his daughter, highlighting the importance of personal relationships. 
        <br></br><br></br>
        The end of the books ramps up quite quickly with the climax. I guess I expected that humanity’s confidence in beating the Trisolaran fleet would soon be proven untrue, but the way the battle with the first droplet played out was unexpected and leaves lots to be wrapped up in the last pages. And just at the moment when there seems to be no hope for humanity, Luo Ji, while seemingly going crazy, creates a solution that proves him to be the only successful Wallfacer. However, the solution is not one he came up with just on his own, but also takes elements from each of the other failed Wallfacers. The novel doesn’t leave any details to waste, with everything having a purpose and effect on the plot. The ending to the novel made me start reading the Death’s End almost immediately since it was left on such a cliffhanger!

        I quite enjoyed this ending to the trilogy. I am always someone who hopes for a happy ending, so finding out that Cheng Xin had missed Tianming by 18 million years at the end of the novel was disappointing. But nevertheless, Liu wrote all the characters to have complex personas and storylines yet made sure the books were readable. Every new development made sense but was still surprising. In Death’s End specifically, I was curious to find out what would happen to humanity when the three options of the Bunker Project, the black domain, and light speed flight were presented. And when the Bunker Project seemed to work out so well, the singular piece of paper completely changed any sort of attack that humanity could have predicted yet was foreshadowed by the previous scene with the fourth-dimension. While these connections in the novel were satisfying, the ending of the trilogy was so satisfying (without the fairytale ending) because it seems to finally have a complete explanation of the universe. It succinctly explained how all the sciences discovered and developed by humans actually played significant roles in every interstellar civilization as well as influenced the universe’s fate. This ending gave a complete overview of what the universe was on a grand scale yet making this ‘old’ universe still seem small as time would continue into another Big Bang and a new universe. As someone who hasn’t read books lately, this trilogy has definitely renewed my commitment to reading as it showed me again how creative writers can be and how deeply invested I can become even in these fantastical fictional plots.

        The tie in with Chinese culture. Having a book that is more centered on the East, from the beginning of the plot starting in China and continuing throughout as language converges into a mix of Chinese and English, was interesting. I felt that culture was much more prevalent in the novels as there were several references to Chinese literature and some puns from Mandarin (although this may also be more memorable because of the footnotes). One connection I made later on was how the characters’ names were tied into their role in the story. I first noticed how the phonetic name Luo Ji looked like the pinyin for ‘logic’ in Mandarin, 逻辑. I didn’t make many other connections since, unfortunately, my Mandarin is not fluent, but I did search it up and found a [Reddit post](https://www.notion.so/Death-s-End-7bc7f923e5b64b18ba2435a19f34fc7e?pvs=21) that translated the names of other characters. Along with what I found in the previous novels in the series with the different translators, this again showed me one aspect lost in translation as the names carried some pretty heavy foreshadowing to the traits and roles of the characters like Cheng Xin. 
        <br></br><br></br>
        The science. To be completely honest, I mostly glossed over the short sections explaining the science of events in the plot, such as curvature propulsion and the man-made black holes. I hope to look these topics more to understand them to a point that allows me to visualize it since this would make the image of the plot so much richer. But anyway, I appreciated Liu’s many references to science which definitely reflects himself as an author coming from an engineering career. While I’m not sure if the science in the novel is accurate to any extent, the theoretical scenarios brought up in the novel on the presence of living beings in the universe and humanity’s fate have made me reconsider many of my previous notions. Whether founded or not, it has made me much more hopeful for humans technological advancement but also more open-minded to what is in the universe. As the whole trilogy’s idea of the ‘dark forest’ is so creative, it serves as a reminder to me that humans simply know so little of the universe that quite literally anything is possible.
