      I quite enjoyed this ending to the trilogy. I am always someone who hopes for a happy ending, so finding out that Cheng Xin had missed Tianming by 18 million years at the end of the novel was disappointing. But nevertheless, Liu wrote all the characters to have complex personas and storylines yet made sure the books were readable. Every new development made sense but was still surprising. In Death’s End specifically, I was curious to find out what would happen to humanity when the three options of the Bunker Project, the black domain, and light speed flight were presented. And when the Bunker Project seemed to work out so well, the singular piece of paper completely changed any sort of attack that humanity could have predicted yet was foreshadowed by the previous scene with the fourth-dimension. While these connections in the novel were satisfying, the ending of the trilogy was so satisfying (without the fairytale ending) because it seems to finally have a complete explanation of the universe. It succinctly explained how all the sciences discovered and developed by humans actually played significant roles in every interstellar civilization as well as influenced the universe’s fate. This ending gave a complete overview of what the universe was on a grand scale yet making this ‘old’ universe still seem small as time would continue into another Big Bang and a new universe. As someone who hasn’t read books lately, this trilogy has definitely renewed my commitment to reading as it showed me again how creative writers can be and how deeply invested I can become even in these fantastical fictional plots.

      The tie in with Chinese culture. Having a book that is more centered on the East, from the beginning of the plot starting in China and continuing throughout as language converges into a mix of Chinese and English, was interesting. I felt that culture was much more prevalent in the novels as there were several references to Chinese literature and some puns from Mandarin (although this may also be more memorable because of the footnotes). One connection I made later on was how the characters’ names were tied into their role in the story. I first noticed how the phonetic name Luo Ji looked like the pinyin for ‘logic’ in Mandarin, 逻辑. I didn’t make many other connections since, unfortunately, my Mandarin is not fluent, but I did search it up and found a [Reddit post](https://www.notion.so/Death-s-End-7bc7f923e5b64b18ba2435a19f34fc7e?pvs=21) that translated the names of other characters. Along with what I found in the previous novels in the series with the different translators, this again showed me one aspect lost in translation as the names carried some pretty heavy foreshadowing to the traits and roles of the characters like Cheng Xin.

      The science. To be completely honest, I mostly glossed over the short sections explaining the science of events in the plot, such as curvature propulsion and the man-made black holes. I hope to look these topics more to understand them to a point that allows me to visualize it since this would make the image of the plot so much richer. But anyway, I appreciated Liu’s many references to science which definitely reflects himself as an author coming from an engineering career. While I’m not sure if the science in the novel is accurate to any extent, the theoretical scenarios brought up in the novel on the presence of living beings in the universe and humanity’s fate have made me reconsider many of my previous notions. Whether founded or not, it has made me much more hopeful for humans technological advancement but also more open-minded to what is in the universe. As the whole trilogy’s idea of the ‘dark forest’ is so creative, it serves as a reminder to me that humans simply know so little of the universe that quite literally anything is possible.
