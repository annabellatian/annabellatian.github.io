        <h1 className='title-start'>Book Review: <span className="title">Norwegian Wood</span>&nbsp; <span className="title">by Haruki Murakami</span></h1>

        Norwegian Wood was a book unlike a lot of books I've read before. I came in with the expectation of the signature surrealism of Murakami as well as the knowledge of his controversial depictions of women. I would say that one of the aspects that stuck out to me most was the description and roles of the women in the story. On numerous points in the book I found the imagery of Naoko to be uncomfortable as they obviously played into the male gaze and Asian beauty standards — pale skin, petite, slender, etc. In addition to this, the story centers on Toru who ends up having some sort of sexual relationship with all of the main female characters. They are unique in nature and offer some character building in understanding Toru and how he develops throughout the novel, but nevertheless, I find it unappealing that essentially all the women serve Toru and his character arc.

        On the other hand, the subject matter of the book was intriguing. Each of the characters feels very deeply, having experienced traumatic experiences, but responding to each differently. Even though the behavior of the characters is illogical or self-sabatoging, it is easy to understand why they do what they do. I think these parts of the book remind us of the inherent choices we all must choose to make in our lives. With memories or worries that can bring us down and lead us down a rabbit-hole of unhappiness, we have to continually <span class="italicized">choose</span> to look at our present and ahead. The sanatorium reminds me that we can't hide away from our problems forever (although it may be helpful to escape and re-frame for some time) because once we go back to reality, these same problems linger. Instead, I think we have to actively engage in reflection on our own thoughts and emotions as well as what matters to us. For Toru, growing up and understanding himself only came when events were thrust upon him — he was forced to make revelations after the fact, which I think made him an unlikeable character. He only realized the gravity of his actions and how he affected others <span class="italicized">after</span> he already made a mistake or hurt them since his thoughts focused on himself and obsessed over Naoko. As a coming-of-age novel, I find this to be my most valuable takeaway from reading it.

        On a side tangent, I enjoyed the motif of music throughout the novel. This book prompted me to listen to “Norwegian Wood” by The Beatles and the scenes of playing music adds a 3-D component to the novel that allowed me to immerse myself in the setting.

        Overall, I think this book was very different from any other I've read before and I can understand the appeal of Murakami's writing. I don't think the issue of misogynistic and over-sexualization of women in the novel can be overlooked and deters me from reading any of Murakami’s other novels, but the book did force me to re-think my perspective on self-reflection and gratitude and has positively impacted my mindset.</h3>
