        <h3>
        Firstly, connecting back to my comments on the first book of the trilogy, The Three-Body Problem, I liked the translation of this book more. It was more fluid than The Three-Body Problem, although this is probably because the wording wasn’t as close to the original Chinese version. This is interesting to me as it reflects the translation style of each translator, Cixin Liu and Joel Martinsen, which is an aspect in reading I’ve never really considered. 
        <br></br><br></br>
        In terms of the plot, I really enjoyed this book. Continuing from the first book, I was confused for a bit since there was some gap in time in the plot between the books but also it took me a while to start the second book after finishing the first book. Honestly, I’m so impressed with the creativity of Cixin Liu and found the book entertaining throughout — I ended up reading the last 200 pages of the book in one sitting! The fates of each of the Wallfacers makes me consider how I would act in these high-pressure, life-or-death situations, since it turns out these heroes on Earth seem to turn their back on most of humanity with the projects they come up with. And I guess the success of Luo Ji, who did not have any motivation to save humanity, is due to the fact that he was threatened with losing Zhuang Yan and his daughter, highlighting the importance of personal relationships. 
        <br></br><br></br>
        The end of the books ramps up quite quickly with the climax. I guess I expected that humanity’s confidence in beating the Trisolaran fleet would soon be proven untrue, but the way the battle with the first droplet played out was unexpected and leaves lots to be wrapped up in the last pages. And just at the moment when there seems to be no hope for humanity, Luo Ji, while seemingly going crazy, creates a solution that proves him to be the only successful Wallfacer. However, the solution is not one he came up with just on his own, but also takes elements from each of the other failed Wallfacers. The novel doesn’t leave any details to waste, with everything having a purpose and effect on the plot. The ending to the novel made me start reading the Death’s End almost immediately since it was left on such a cliffhanger!
